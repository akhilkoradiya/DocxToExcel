# Document Extraction and Excel Export Tool

The Document Extraction and Excel Export Tool is a Python script designed to simplify the extraction and organization of structured data from multiple Microsoft Word documents (DOCX files) into an Excel spreadsheet. This tool is particularly useful for parsing and summarizing information from various documents, such as security reports or technical documentation, into a structured format for further analysis or reporting.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Extract specific content located between user-defined start and end headers within DOCX files.
- **Heading Extraction**: Identify and extract headings with a specified format (e.g., "Heading 1") within the DOCX files.
- **Excel Export**: Organize extracted data into an Excel spreadsheet, customizable with column headers for different data fields.
- **Word Wrap Support**: Ensure cell contents, including line breaks (indicated by "\n"), are displayed correctly within the Excel sheet.
- **Multiple File Processing**: Process multiple DOCX files in a specified directory for batch processing.

## Use Cases

- **Security Reports**: Easily consolidate vulnerability information, impact assessments, remediation steps, and references from various security reports.
- **Technical Documentation**: Streamline the extraction of content from different sections of technical documents for creating summaries or structured reports.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize the generated Excel spreadsheet as a dataset for data analysis, visualization, or integration with other tools.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Efficiently manage and organize data from multiple sources into a standardized format, reducing manual effort.

## Requirements

- **Python**: The tool is written in Python and requires a Python interpreter to run.
- **Required Python Libraries**: The tool uses libraries such as `docx` for working with DOCX files and `pandas` for data manipulation and Excel export. These libraries can be installed using `pip`.

## How to Use

## How to Use

Follow these steps to utilize the Document Extraction and Excel Export Tool:

1. **Prepare Your DOCX Files**: Ensure you have the DOCX files that you want to process. Make sure these files follow a consistent structure, including the presence of defined start and end headers if required for extraction.

2. **Copy DOCX Files to the "Data" Directory**: Copy all the DOCX files into the "Data" directory, which should be located in the same directory as your Python script (`main.py`). This directory will serve as the source for document processing.

> **Configure the Script (Optional)**: Open `main.py` and customize the script's configuration to match your specific requirements. You can specify the start and end headers for content extraction and adjust other settings as needed.

3. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your Python script and the "Data" directory, and execute the Python command:
```
python3 main.py
```

This command will trigger the script to process the DOCX files within the "Data" directory.

4. **Review the Excel Output**: After the script completes processing, you can find the generated Excel spreadsheet (named "output.xlsx" by default) in the same directory. Open this Excel file to review the extracted and organized data.

> **Customize Output and Analysis (Optional)**: You can further customize the generated Excel file, perform data analysis, visualization, or integrate the data with other tools according to your specific use case.

**Note:** Please note that you may need to have the required Python libraries installed, as specified in the README or documentation, to successfully run the tool. Additionally, make sure to customize the script's configuration to suit your data extraction needs before running it.
